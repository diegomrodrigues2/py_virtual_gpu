# Detailed Plan for Implementing a CPU-Based Virtual GPU for Learning and Data Parallelism

## 1. Introduction: Why Build a Virtual GPU in Python?

### 1.1. Demystifying GPU Computing

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are essential for high-performance computing and data-intensive tasks. Their massively parallel architecture differs from traditional CPUs and excels at handling many operations simultaneously. Understanding GPU internals and the CUDA/OpenCL programming model is key to optimizing parallel applications. A virtual GPU built in Python offers a safe, accessible way to explore these concepts without expensive hardware.

### 1.2. Objectives and Scope

The main goal is to create a functional simulation of core GPU componentsâ€”Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), CUDA cores (or Streaming Processors) and the memory hierarchy including registers, shared memory and global memory. The simulator should faithfully represent the programming model so users can see how kernels, grids and blocks map to underlying hardware. Multi-GPU scenarios and data distribution strategies are also part of the plan.

The focus is on conceptual accuracy rather than cycle-accurate timing. Implementing a detailed microarchitecture simulator would be far more complex and is outside the scope of a learning-focused Python project.

## 2. GPU Architecture Overview

### 2.1. Streaming Multiprocessors and Compute Units

Describe how SMs group CUDA cores and manage warps. Highlight the SIMT execution model and the role of scheduling.

### 2.2. Memory Hierarchy

Discuss registers, shared memory, L1/L2 caches and global memory. Explain how memory access patterns affect performance.

### 2.3. Warp Execution and Divergence

Explain how warps execute instructions in lock-step and how control flow divergence is handled with a SIMT stack.

## 3. Simulator Components

Outline the classes `VirtualGPU`, `StreamingMultiprocessor`, `ThreadBlock`, `Thread`, memory spaces and helper utilities like `SIMTStack`.

## 4. Execution Flow

Walk through kernel launch, block scheduling across SMs, warp creation and how threads access memory during execution.

## 5. Multi-GPU Experiments

Describe how multiple virtual GPUs can run in separate processes and communicate via queues or pipes to simulate data-parallel workloads.

## 6. Monitoring and Debugging Tools

Propose logging, event tracing and performance counters to help users inspect memory accesses, divergences and other metrics.

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

A Python-based virtual GPU is a valuable educational tool. By prioritizing clarity over microarchitectural detail, learners can experiment with kernels, memory management and synchronization without specialized hardware. Starting with simple vector addition and moving toward more complex examples like matrix multiplication or convolution helps build intuition about parallel programming on GPUs.
